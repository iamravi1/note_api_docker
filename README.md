# Notes App API
This is a REST API for a basic notes app that allows users to create, edit, delete, and fetch notes. The API is built using Node.js and the Express.js web framework. The notes are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- npm
- Express.js
- mongoose
## Installation
### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/iamravi1/notes_api_docker.git
```
### Install the dependencies:
```
cd notes-app-api
npm install
```
### Set the following environment variables:
MONGODB_URI: the URI for your MongoDB database
PORT: the port that the server will listen on (default is 3000)
Start the server:
```

### Command to pull the docker image

```
docker pull iamravi1/notes-app-api:1.0
```

### Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t notes-app-api .

### Explanation:
Docker Compose is a useful tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define the services, networks, and volumes required by your application in a single YAML file. This makes it easy to start up your entire application stack with just one command.

Using Docker Compose simplifies the process of deploying a complex application. You can define multiple containers and the relationships between them in a single file. This helps manage dependencies between containers, making it easy to start, stop, and scale your application as needed.

To build our notes app, we will use a Dockerfile. This file contains instructions on how to build a Docker image, which can then be used to create a container for our notes app.

With the docker-compose.yml file, we can build the notes-api image and pull the mongo image from Docker Hub. The mongo container will bind to port 27017, while the notes-api container will bind to port 3000.

Overall, Docker Compose and the Dockerfile are powerful tools that simplify the deployment process for complex applications. They allow developers to easily manage multiple containers and dependencies, making it easy to scale applications as needed.
